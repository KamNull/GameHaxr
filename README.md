# WebGameHaxr
A memory-based and automation hacking "engine" specifically optimized for browser games, allowing you to easily make your own scripts with UIs using JavaScript and HTML by exposing the WebGameHaxr C# .NET classes directly to the browser.

The easy way to make advanced hacks and trainers (UIs) for your favorite browser games.
Thanks to Cheat Engine's Lua and AutoHotKey, you can also integrate Lua and AutoHotKey into your Javascript, or even code just with them, for more advanced usage.

# Interfaces For Your Hacks
You can use a regular HTML document with any framework, such as Bootstrap, to make beautiful interfaces for your hack.

# What WebGameHaxr Exposes To JavaScript
Currently, you get 3 major classes from WebGameHaxr to use in JavaScript:
