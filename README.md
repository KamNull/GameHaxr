## GameHaxr
[Visit Official Website](http://gamehaxr.rf.gd)

A powerful hacking "engine" to create trainers for games using JavaScript* and HTML, made possible by bridging C# .NET classes to its browser. 

The easy way to make advanced hacks and trainers (UIs) for your favorite desktop or browser games.  
Thanks to Cheat Engine Lua and AutoHotKey, you can have memory hacks, macros, image recognition, and more, to make a variety of amazing hacks.

## Interfaces For Your Hacks
You can use a regular HTML document with any framework, such as Bootstrap, to make beautiful interfaces for your hack.

## What GameHaxr Exposes To JavaScript
Currently, you get 6 classes from GameHaxr to use in JavaScript:
- [`engine`](https://github.com/KamNull/GameHaxr/wiki/Functions-and-Properties#engine-core-functions) | The core class for important variables and functions.
- [`lua`](https://github.com/KamNull/GameHaxr/wiki/Functions-and-Properties#lua-cheat-engine-lua) | Full access to Cheat Engine Lua.

- [`engineIO`](https://github.com/KamNull/GameHaxr/wiki/Functions-and-Properties#file-io) | Simple file IO functions.
- [`csharp`](https://github.com/KamNull/GameHaxr/wiki/Functions-and-Properties#csharp) | **Experimental** - Compile and use custom C# code in your trainer.
